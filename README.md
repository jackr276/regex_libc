## Introduction
This project is a custom implementation of a regular expression matching library, using **Thompson's Construction**, also known as the **McNaughton–Yamada–Thompson algorithm** for regular expression to NFA conversion. It serves both as a learning exercise for me, and as a tool that I will continue to use in other projects of my own. If other people wish to use or improve upon my project here, I welcome that and as such have licensed this under GPL 3.0.


This is a work in progress currently, and is intended to be a regular expression library that I use for myself when programming in C. In it's current implementation, we will only support *, ?, (), | and +. I am hoping to continue to build atop it
as needed.
